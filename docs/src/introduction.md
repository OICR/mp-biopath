MP-BioPath is a biological pathway tool used to infer the activity of individual pathways. The tool implements a novel approach, using Mathematical Programming, to infer pathway activity. It can read a combination of copy number, mutation, expression level, and proteomic data to make these inferences. The tool uses evidence of biological perturbations to infer the activity of the remaining nodes in the specified pathway.
