Results

The results will be output in the same format as the evidence files, where there will be a row for each of the nodes in the pathway and the columns will match the samples.

These files will be located in a subfolder for each of the pathways specified in the run.

From these results, there are tools for generating heatmaps and performing further analysis. We intend to provide a more robust set of tools for analyzing the results generated by this program.
