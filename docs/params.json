{"name":"LibNet","tagline":"Machine learning tool for perfoming both inference and learning with probabilistic graphical models.","body":"Libnet is used for performing both learning and inference on graphical probabilistic models. The tool has been designed to run as fast as possible. As a result the tool has been written in the programming language C and a perfect hashing algorithm has been used in order to quickly look up the individual nodes. The main program gets compiled into a a shared object. There are two interfaces to the shared object, these are a command line interface and a R programming interface. \r\n\r\nThe program reads and writes data to flat files. The format of these flat files are specified in the documentation.  With both the R and command line interface the user can specify both files and run time parameters.  \r\n\r\n##Contributors\r\n\r\n   - Hossein Radfar (mhradfar@oicr.on.ca)\r\n   - Adam Wright (adam.wright@oicr.on.ca)\r\n\r\n##Documentation\r\n   The tools documentation can be found here: [https://github.com/OICR/LibNet/wiki](https://github.com/OICR/LibNet/wiki).
